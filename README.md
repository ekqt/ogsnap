## What is OpenGraphUI?

OpenGraphUI is a collection of open-sourced components and templates to build engaging open graph images faster. Its purpose is to empower developers to create great visual content as quickly as possible.

## How Does It Work?

All of our components and tempalates are based and tested on [Vercel's Image Generation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) library powered by [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori).

You can either start from a template and work your way through what you need, or start from scratch choosing any components you want. There are no packages or installs, just grab the code and get going.
